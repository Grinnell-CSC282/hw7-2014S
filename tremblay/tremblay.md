Tremblay Explanation
====================

I don't really remember this project, but this Makefile has several interesting aspects, including `clean`, `test` and `all` options. There are multiple flags at the top (one for regular compilation and one for testing?), multiple variable for use in the entries, and also entries for building each individual file and for creating the submission package, a tar folder with the README, the script, the Makefile, and all .c and .h files.

Note: In CSC161 with Sam, we used Make regularly, so I couldn't find a good project for which creating a new Makefile would yield something interesting.

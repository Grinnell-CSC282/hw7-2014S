Clover Makefile
---------------
This is a Makefile for a project for CSC 323. It does not use anything complicated. In fact, I even included things that Make can figure out on its own, for the sake of clarity. I have not tested it, because I forgot that one of the files relies on a library I have not downloaded, but I think the syntax is right.
